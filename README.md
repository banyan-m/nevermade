# Nevermade Radio: The Radio by Robots


Nevermade radio is a custom made radio station that leverages Meta's Musicgen model. It uses OpenAI and Elevenlabs to generate music lore and DJ's. 

The Musicgen model is hosted on Huggingface. As part of this project, I implemented a few techniques to extend and connect its context window so that the music could be coherent for longer periods of time.
